The development of DeepSeek has far reaching implications on more sectors than the technology sector and Nvidia stock.. it means the growth forecast in the gas and energy sector needs revision, AI models can be developed with less sophisticated chips consuming less electricity. Good news for the environment.

In all cases having more actors compete on developing reliable AI models is positive for all the industries posed to be affected by AI. monopoly serves no one, and competition is far more exciting.
